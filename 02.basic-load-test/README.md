# Run a basic load test

_**Need help?** Raise your hand and we'll come help._

In this exercise, you'll run your first load test.

During normal operation, QuickPizza typically receives around **50 concurrent users**. Let's use that as the starting point for our first test.

How long should the test run? For meaningful results, load tests are often run for **at least 5 minutes** to observe how the system behaves under sustained load.

For this workshop, we'll keep things short and set the duration to **1 minute**.

```js
export const options = {
  vus: 50,
  duration: '1m',
};
```

This configuration generates a flat traffic pattern: the test starts with 50 virtual users and ends with 50 virtual users.

In practice, traffic usually ramps up over time. You can model this behavior using ramping stages.

A common recommendation is to spend between 5% and 10% of the total duration ramping up and ramping down the load.

Now, update the previous `k6-test.js` test:

1. Use the [`stages` k6 option](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#stages) to configure a ramping load pattern, with a total duration of `1m`.

2. In the test scenario, add a 1-second pause after ordering a pizza using [`sleep(1)`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6/sleep/). 

When your `k6-test.js` is ready, run it with the `--out` option.

```bash
k6 run --out web-dashboard k6-test.js
```

The `--out web-dashboard` option displays metrics in a simple web dashboard so you can watch test results in real time. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5665/ui/](http://127.0.0.1:5665/ui/).

Finally, explore these common performance metrics:

- **Virtual users** (traffic)
- **Request duration** (latency)
- **Request failed** (errors)
